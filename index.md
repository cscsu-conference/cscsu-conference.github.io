# Fifth Annual Computer Science Conference for CSU Undergraduates
# Held Virtually on April 26, 2025

CSCSU is an annual conference dedicated to computer science research by undergraduates at CSU campuses. Participating students will learn how a computer science conference works, network with other talented CS students from CSU campuses, and prepare for graduate school and research careers. The conference covers all areas of computer science and is structured like a mainstream CS conference, with authors of accepted papers giving oral presentations. A peer-review process is used to select papers for presentation and inclusion in conference proceedings that will be made available electronically.

## Call for Papers ##
Submissions are welcomed in all areas of computer science. To encourage participation, papers of any of the following types can be submitted:

* Traditional technical papers
* Extensive experimentation with existing tools and techniques
* Reimplementation of an existing tool or technique, with new insights and lessons learned
* Literature surveys, ideally targeted to newcomers to an area
* Tutorials
* Instructional pearls

The paper type must be identified when a paper is submitted. Each paper will be reviewed using the criteria associated with its type. More information about the paper types can be found [here](https://cscsu-conference.github.io/Paper%20types%202022.pdf), including example papers and acceptance criteria for each type.

Papers must be written under the guidance of a CSU faculty co-author. The first author of every submitted paper must be a CSU undergraduate. All authors must be either CSU faculty advisors (there must be at least one) or CSU undergraduates at the time of submission.

No faculty member can appear as a co-author on more than 3 submissions.

For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, one of the student authors must commit to presenting their work at the conference. Submitted papers must not have been published in other conferences or journals.

## Important Dates ##

* Submission Deadline: February 23, 2025
* Conference Dates: April 26, 2025

## Submission Guidelines
Submissions must be no more than 5 pages, including all figures, tables, and references. Papers must be submitted as PDF documents through the EasyChair conference system. LaTeX is strongly recommended for paper preparation, but Word can also be used. Please use the [LaTeX](https://cscsu-conference.github.io/LatexTemplate.zip) or [Word](https://cscsu-conference.github.io/WordTemplate.docx) templates . More information on the use of the templates can be found on the paper submission page for the [Computing in Cardiology conference](http://www.cinc.org/instructions-for-preparing-and-submitting-full-papers/).
